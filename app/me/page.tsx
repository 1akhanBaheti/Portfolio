            Hello! I&apos;m Lakhan, an enthusiastic creator in the realm of digital
            innovation. My journey into the world of app development commenced
            in 2020, during my pursuit of a B.Tech in computer science. Since
            then, I&apos;ve been captivated by the endless possibilities that the
            internet offers.

            Evolution in App Development:
          </h2>
          <p className="text-custom-text-200 font-paragraph text-base pt-1">
            My fascination with programming languages led me to delve into
            native Android Development initially. However, my quest for
            innovation led me to explore newer avenues, ultimately leading me to
            embrace Flutter as my primary platform for app development.
